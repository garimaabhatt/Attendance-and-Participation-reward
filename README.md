# Attendance & Participation Rewards

## Project Description

The Attendance & Participation Rewards project is a blockchain-based smart contract system designed to incentivize student engagement in educational settings. Students earn tokens for consistent class attendance and active participation, which can be redeemed for various educational benefits such as textbook vouchers, meal credits, or partial tuition rebates.

This decentralized solution provides transparent tracking of student engagement while creating a merit-based reward system that motivates academic involvement. Instructors can easily mark attendance and record participation, while students can view their accumulated rewards in real-time.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to revolutionize student engagement by leveraging blockchain technology to create a transparent, fair, and motivating reward system. We aim to:

- **Foster Active Learning**: Encourage students to attend classes regularly and participate actively in discussions
- **Transparent Tracking**: Provide immutable records of attendance and participation that students can trust
- **Financial Incentives**: Help students offset educational costs through their own dedication and engagement
- **Reduce Dropout Rates**: Increase student retention by rewarding consistent effort and involvement
- **Empower Educators**: Give instructors easy-to-use tools to recognize and reward student effort
